// turbo-all
1. Review the latest `task.md` and `walkthrough.md` to identify new features and architectural changes.
2. Update the `🏗 System Architecture` section in `USERMANUAL.md` if the infrastructure has evolved (e.g., Cloud Hosting, Modal Volumes).
3. Add or update the `🚀 Getting Started` section with new deployment commands (e.g., `modal deploy`).
4. Ensure the `🛠 Core Workflows` section includes the latest user-facing features (e.g., Shared Links).
5. Verify that all links and bash commands are accurate.
6. Commit the changes and notify the user.
